  Hint "Since we're differentiating a fraction, apply the quotient rule with `deriv_div`."
  rw [deriv_div]

  Hint "The numerator is a constant (1), so differentiating it gives zero."

  Hint "Apply the chain rule on the denominator, which is (x + 1/x)^2. Start by differentiating the outer square function."
  rw [deriv_pow'']  -- Chain rule for the outer square function

  Hint "Now, use the chain rule for the inner function (x + 1/x), starting with the sum rule."

  Hint "Simplify the expression further with algebraic tactics like `ring_nf`."
