-- The derivative of frac{(x-1)^4}{(x^2 +2x)^5}



Statement (x : ℝ) (hx1 : (x^2 + 2*x)^5 ≠ 0) :

  Hint "##Introduction
  $\\frac\{(x-1)^4}\{(x^2+2x)^5}$We want to use function composition so first we define several functions, one each for (u^4), (x-1), (u^5), (x^2+2x)"
  set f₁ := (fun u : ℝ  => u^4); set g₁ := (fun x : ℝ  => x - 1)
  set f₂ := (fun u : ℝ  => u^5); set g₂ := (fun x : ℝ  => x^2 + 2*x)
  Hint "Prove some lemmas to show that (x-1)^4 is a composition of two functions, and do the same for (x^2 + 2*x)^5, using rfl to prove"
  have top : (fun x => (x-1)^4) = f₁ ∘ g₁

  Hint "We also prove differentiability of (x^2 + 2*x) which will be used later"

    Hint "First use DifferentiableAt.add since it's 2 functions added together, then differentiableAt_pow for the first half"

  Hint "Since we are dealing with a quotient, use rw the statement with deriv_div"
  rw [deriv_div]
  Hint "Use rw to replace (x-1)^4 and (x^2 + 2*x)^5 with the composition proven earlier"
  rw [top, bottom]
  Hint "Now apply deriv.comp, which gives the derivative of a composite function"
  rw [deriv.comp, deriv.comp]
  Hint "rw with deriv_pow twice to compute the derivatives of u^4 and u^5"
  rw [deriv_pow, deriv_pow]
  Hint "Now to rw deriv(x-1), use deriv_sub_const for functions with a constant subtracted away"
  rw [deriv_sub_const, deriv_id'']
  Hint "For deriv(x^2 + 2*x), use deriv_add, deriv_const_mul, deriv_id''"

  Hint "use simp to reduce to the final answer"

  Hint "Use DifferentiableAt.const_mul for functions multiplied with a constant"
  apply DifferentiableAt.const_mul; exact differentiableAt_id
  Hint "Remember this is just the function u^5 but evaluated at a different value instead of just x"
  apply differentiableAt_pow
  Hint "Use the lemma we proved for differentiability of (x^2 + 2*x)"
  exact diff_g₂
  Hint "Same as before, this is just proving differentiability of function u^4 evaluated at some different point"
  apply differentiableAt_pow
  apply DifferentiableAt.sub_const; exact differentiableAt_id
  Hint "For this, we need to use DifferentiableAt.comp, which requires us to rewrite into a function composition again"
  rw [top]
  Hint "Other than that, just have to prove that both functions in the composition are differentiable"
  apply DifferentiableAt.comp; apply differentiableAt_pow; apply DifferentiableAt.sub_const; exact differentiableAt_id
